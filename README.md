# calmdown

## Do you ever feel like `tree` runs so fast you can't even read it?
Well, there's a solution now! `tree / | calmdown 5` will add a 5ms delay between each character so you can comfortably read the output.
## Do you use an ugly application that can't keep up with stdin? Give it some time with `calmdown`. Also, what the f?

Using it is easy. Just put `calmdown [time in ms]` in the middle of a pipe and enjoy.
